These are my custom snippets for yasnippet and auto-complete mode.

* nxml-mode
These snippets are intended to be used to insert some useful tags specific to AndroidManifest.xml
files. The proper setup to use these snippets is to defined the following auto-complete setup within
your .emacs file:

;; android specific settings
;; AndroidManifest.xml
(defun ac-android-manifest-nxml-setup()
  (when (string= (buffer-name) "AndroidManifest.xml")
    (setq ac-sources '(ac-source-yasnippet
                       ac-source-abbrev
                       ac-source-dictionary
                       ac-source-words-in-same-mode-buffers))
    ((lambda () (auto-complete-mode 1)))))
(add-hook 'nxml-mode-hook 'ac-android-manifest-nxml-setup)
